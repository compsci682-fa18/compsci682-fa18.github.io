In this assignment you will implement recurrent networks, and apply them to image captioning on Microsoft COCO. We will also introduce the TinyImageNet dataset, and use a pretrained model on this dataset to explore different applications of image gradients.

The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Understand the architecture of *recurrent neural networks (RNNs)* and how they operate on sequences by sharing weights over time
- Understand the difference between vanilla RNNs and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs
- Understand how to sample from an RNN at test-time
- Understand how to combine convolutional neural nets and recurrent nets to implement an image captioning system
- Understand how a trained convolutional network can be used to compute gradients with respect to the input image
- Implement and different applications of image gradients, including saliency maps, fooling images, class visualizations, feature inversion, and DeepDream.

## Setup
Get the code as a zip file [here](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/697l/asgns/assignment3.zip). As for the dependencies:

**[Option 1] Use Anaconda:**
The preferred approach for installing all the assignment dependencies is to use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which is a Python distribution that includes many of the most popular Python packages for science, math, engineering and data analysis. Once you install it you can skip all mentions of requirements and you're ready to go directly to working on the assignment.

**[Option 2] Manual install, virtual environment:**
If you'd like to (instead of Anaconda) go with a more manual and risky installation route you will likely want to create a [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) for the project. If you choose not to use a virtual environment, it is up to you to make sure that all dependencies for the code are installed globally on your machine. To set up a virtual environment, run the following:

```bash
cd assignment3
sudo pip install virtualenv      # This may already be installed
virtualenv .env                  # Create a virtual environment
source .env/bin/activate         # Activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
# Work on the assignment for a while ...
deactivate                       # Exit the virtual environment
```

**Download data:**
Once you have the starter code, you will need to download the processed MS-COCO dataset, the TinyImageNet dataset, and the pretrained TinyImageNet model. Run the following from the `assignment3` directory:

```bash
cd datasets
./get_coco_captioning.sh
./get_tiny_imagenet_a.sh
./get_pretrained_model.sh
```

**Compile the Cython extension:** Convolutional Neural Networks require a very
efficient implementation. We have implemented of the functionality using
[Cython](http://cython.org/); you will need to compile the Cython extension
before you can run the code. From the `assignment3/asgn3` directory, run the following
command:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

**Start Jupyter Notebook:**
After you have the data, you should start the Jupyter Notebook server
from the `assignment3` directory. If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter, you should 
read our [Jupyter tutorial](/notes/jupyter-tutorial/).

**NOTE:** If you are working in a virtual environment on OSX, you may encounter
errors with matplotlib due to the
[issues described here](http://matplotlib.org/faq/virtualenv_faq.html).
You can work around this issue by starting the Jupyter server using the
`start_ipython_osx.sh` script from the `assignment3` directory; the script
assumes that your virtual environment is named `.env`.


### Submitting your work:
To make sure everything is working properly, **remember to do a clean run ("Kernel -> Restart & Run All") after you finish work for each notebook** and submit the final version with all the outputs. 
Once you are done working, zip all the code and notebooks in a single file and upload it to Moodle. On Linux or macOS you can run the provided `collectSubmission.sh` script from `assignment3/` to produce a file `assignment3.zip`.

### Q1: Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs (40 points)
The Jupyter notebook `RNN_Captioning.ipynb` will walk you through the
implementation of an image captioning system on MS-COCO using vanilla recurrent
networks.

### Q2: Image Captioning with LSTMs (35 points)
The Jupyter notebook `LSTM_Captioning.ipynb` will walk you through the
implementation of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs, and apply them to image
captioning on MS-COCO.

### Q3: Image Gradients: Saliency maps and Fooling Images (10 points)
The Jupyter notebook `ImageGradients.ipynb` will introduce the TinyImageNet
dataset. You will use a pretrained model on this dataset to compute gradients
with respect to the image, and use them to produce saliency maps and fooling
images.

### Q4: Image Generation: Classes, Inversion, DeepDream (15 points)
In the Jupyter notebook `ImageGeneration.ipynb` you will use the pretrained
TinyImageNet model to generate images. In particular you will generate
class visualizations and implement feature inversion and DeepDream.

### Q5: Do something extra! (up to +10 points)
Given the components of the assignment, try to do something cool. Maybe there is
some way to generate images that we did not implement in the assignment?
